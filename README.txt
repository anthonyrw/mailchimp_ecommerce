Mailchimp's eCommerce API.

## Dependencies

  * Mailchimp: https://www.drupal.org/project/mailchimp
  * Mailchimp Audiences

## Optional Dependencies

  This module supports two eCommerce platforms. Only one should be enabled
  at any time.

  * Commerce: https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce
  * Ubercart: https://www.drupal.org/project/ubercart

## Installation

  * Ensure you have the Mailchimp module configured with your API key.

## Installation Notes

  ### For Drupal Commerce

    * Enable the Mailchimp eCommerce Commerce module.

  ### For Ubercart

    * Enable the Mailchimp eCommerce Ubercart module.

## Configuration

  * Connect your Drupal Commerce or Ubercart store to MailChimp at this path:
      /admin/config/services/mailchimp/ecommerce

  * Enter a name for your store and select a MailChimp audience.
    Stores are mapped one-to-one with audiences.

## For Existing Stores

  If you already have an active Drupal Commerce or Ubercart store, you must
  sync your existing products to MailChimp. You may optionally sync existing
  orders.

  You will find options to sync both products and orders at this path:
    /admin/config/services/mailchimp/ecommerce

  If syncing existing orders, you will need to sync existing products first.

## Testing

  ### Mailchimp API Playground

    Mailchimp provides a way to interact with their API via your web browser.

    You are able to execute API commands that will show your eCommerce stores,
    products, orders, and customers here.

      * drush mcstores
        Retrieve a list of stores attached to your API key.

      * drush mcorders [store ID]
        Retrieve a list of orders for a given store ID.
        Store IDs are available via the mcstores drush command.
